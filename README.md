#NFC-Ring_CredentialProvider

##Summary

This CP (Credential Provider) allows login to Windows with an RFID Reader.

In contrast to the other forks this centered around the NFC-Ring (http://nfcring.com/).

##Goals

 - Increase ease of use. Maybe with an small config application?
 - Eventualy edit login mechanism to store the credentials on the NFC Ring (it has only 144bytes). - Should work the way it is.
 - Add an Option for a connection without COM-Ports (for Windows 8).
 - Add the option for translations.
